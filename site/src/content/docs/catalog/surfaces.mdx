<SystemDemo>

Surfaces are the containers that hold your content. They define the background color, border color, and text context for everything inside them.

## The Canvas

These surfaces form the backdrop of your application.

### `surface-page`

The infinite background. This is usually applied to the `<body>` tag.

<Diagram className="surface-page docs-p-4 docs-rounded docs-border">
  This is the Page surface.
</Diagram>

### `surface-workspace`

A slightly elevated area, often used for sidebars, navigation rails, or the main content area in a dashboard.

<Diagram className="surface-page docs-p-4 docs-rounded docs-border">
  <div class="surface-workspace docs-p-4 docs-rounded docs-border">
    This is the Workspace surface.
  </div>
</Diagram>

## The Containers

These surfaces sit _on top_ of the canvas.

### `surface-card`

The primary container for grouped content. It has a distinct background color that separates it from the canvas.

<Diagram className="surface-page docs-p-4 docs-rounded docs-border">
  <div class="surface-card docs-p-4 docs-rounded">This is a Card.</div>
</Diagram>

### `surface-tinted`

A subtle grouping mechanism. It usually has a slight tint of the brand color (or another semantic color) to highlight a section without a hard boundary.

<Diagram className="surface-card docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
  <div class="surface-tinted docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
    This is a Tinted surface inside a Card.
  </div>
</Diagram>

## The Spotlights

These surfaces demand attention. They often use **Inverted Polarity** (Dark on Light, or Light on Dark) to stand out.

### `surface-spotlight`

High contrast. Used for tooltips, toasts, and primary call-to-actions.

<Diagram className="surface-page docs-p-4 docs-rounded docs-border">
  <div class="surface-spotlight docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
    This is a Spotlight.
  </div>
</Diagram>

### `surface-soft-spotlight`

A softer version of the spotlight. Useful for badges or indicators that need to be distinct but not shouting.

<Diagram className="surface-page docs-p-4 docs-rounded docs-border">
  <div class="surface-soft-spotlight docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
    This is a Soft Spotlight.
  </div>
</Diagram>

## Elevation (Shadows)

Shadows provide depth and hierarchy. The system generates a semantic scale of shadows that are subtle in Light Mode and stronger in Dark Mode to ensure visibility.

<Diagram
  className="surface-card bordered"
  style={{
    padding: "2rem",
    display: "grid",
    gridTemplateColumns: "repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr))",
    gap: "2rem",
  }}
>
  <div
    class="surface-card shadow-sm bordered"
    style="height: 100px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"
  >
    shadow-sm
  </div>
  <div
    class="surface-card shadow-md bordered"
    style="height: 100px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"
  >
    shadow-md
  </div>
  <div
    class="surface-card shadow-lg bordered"
    style="height: 100px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"
  >
    shadow-lg
  </div>
  <div
    class="surface-card shadow-xl bordered"
    style="height: 100px; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;"
  >
    shadow-xl
  </div>
</Diagram>
