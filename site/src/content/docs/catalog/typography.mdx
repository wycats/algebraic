In the Axiomatic Color, you don't pick text colors. You pick **Text Hierarchy**.

The system automatically calculates the correct color for each level of hierarchy based on the surface it sits on, ensuring APCA compliance.

## Text Hierarchy

### `text-strong` (Primary)

Used for headings, titles, and primary content. This has the highest contrast against the background.

<Diagram class="surface-card docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
  <h1 class="text-strong">This is Strong Text</h1>
</Diagram>

### `text-subtle` (Secondary)

Used for body text, descriptions, and secondary content. It has lower contrast than strong text but is still fully readable.

<Diagram class="surface-card docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
  <p class="text-subtle">
    This is subtle text. It is easier on the eyes for long reading.
  </p>
</Diagram>

### `text-subtler` (Tertiary)

Used for metadata, captions, and low-emphasis content.

<Diagram class="surface-card docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
  <span class="text-subtler">Posted 2 hours ago</span>
</Diagram>

### `text-link` (Interactive)

Used for hyperlinks and interactive text elements. It uses the brand hue (or a specific link hue) and ensures contrast.

<Diagram class="surface-card docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
  <a href="#" class="text-link">
    Read more ->
  </a>
</Diagram>

## Context Adaptation

The power of these classes is that they adapt to their container.

<Diagram class="docs-grid">
  <div class="surface-card docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
    <strong>Light Context</strong>
    <div class="text-strong">Strong</div>
    <div class="text-subtle">Subtle</div>
  </div>
  <div class="surface-spotlight docs-p-4 docs-rounded">
    <strong>Dark Context</strong>
    <div class="text-strong">Strong</div>
    <div class="text-subtle">Subtle</div>
  </div>
</Diagram>

Notice how `text-strong` is dark on the card but light on the spotlight. You didn't have to change the class name.
