**Static palettes are not enough for modern interfaces.**

In a dynamic UI, colors change based on where they live. A "gray" text needs to be dark on a white card, but light on a dark tooltip.

Axiomatic Color acts as a **Context Engine**. Instead of giving you a fixed list of colors, it gives you **Surfaces** that automatically adjust their content to fit the environment.

## The Core Concept

A **Surface** is not just a background color. It **sets the rules** for everything inside it.

When you place an element on a surface, you aren't just painting pixels. You are entering a new **Context**.

### 1. Surfaces Create Context

Every surface acts as a "Context Provider." It automatically sets a suite of CSS variables that determine how text, borders, and other elements should look _when sitting on that specific surface_.

<Diagram>
  <div class="mb-4 text-sm text-text-subtle">
    Click on any surface below to inspect its active tokens.
  </div>
  <ContextVisualizer client:load />
</Diagram>

In the visualization above:

1.  The **Page** sets the baseline context (Light Mode).
2.  The **Card** sits on the Page. It might be slightly lighter or darker, but it maintains the same "Polarity" (Light text on Dark, or Dark text on Light).
3.  The **Spotlight** (the dark box) _inverts_ the polarity. It tells its children: "I am dark. You must be light."

### 2. Content Adapts to Context

Because of this architecture, your components become **portable**.

You don't write CSS like `.card .text` or `.footer .text`. You just write `.text-strong`.

- If `.text-strong` is on a white card, it resolves to black.
- If `.text-strong` is on a black tooltip, it resolves to white.

The component doesn't know where it is. The _Surface_ tells it how to render.

## The Hierarchy of Surfaces

We categorize surfaces based on their physical role in the UI, not their color.

### The Canvas

These are the foundations. They recede into the background.

- **Page**: The infinite backdrop.
- **Workspace**: A dedicated area for tools or navigation.

### The Objects

These sit _on top_ of the canvas. They hold your content.

- **Card**: The primary container for information.
- **Tinted**: A subtle grouping mechanism, often used to highlight a section without a hard border.

### The Interactors

These are actionable. They invite touch.

- **Action**: Buttons, toggles, and controls.

### The Spotlights

These demand attention. They often break the current polarity to stand out.

- **Spotlight**: Tooltips, toasts, and primary calls-to-action.

**Note on Inversion**: Spotlight surfaces perform a "Hard Flip" of the theme. If your app is in Light Mode, a Spotlight surface forces its internals into Dark Mode (and vice versa). This ensures that native browser controls (like scrollbars and checkboxes) render correctly inside the inverted area.

## Why This Matters

By thinking in surfaces, you stop fighting with contrast ratios.

1.  **Guaranteed Contrast**: The system calculates the foreground colors based on the background surface. If the surface changes, the text changes.
2.  **Automatic Dark Mode**: You don't design "Dark Mode" separately. You just define your surfaces, and the system flips the context.
3.  **Infinite Nesting**: You can put a Card inside a Sidebar inside a Page. The system handles the math to ensure distinctness at every level.
