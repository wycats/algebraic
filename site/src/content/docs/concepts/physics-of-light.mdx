If "Surfaces" are the atoms of the system, **Anchors** are the laws of physics that govern them.

The Axiomatic Color doesn't store a list of colors for every surface. Instead, it calculates them dynamically based on a set of boundary conditions.

## The Dynamic Range

Imagine a vertical axis representing Lightness, from 0% (Absolute Black) to 100% (Absolute White). Every theme is defined by a **Dynamic Range** on this axis.

### Anchors: The Boundary Conditions

An **Anchor** is a fixed point on this scale. It tells the solver: _"This is where the world begins, and this is where it ends."_

## The "Rubber Band" Effect

The most powerful aspect of this physics model is that surfaces are **relative**, not absolute.

If you decide your Dark Mode is too dark, you don't have to manually adjust every single card, sidebar, and button. You simply move the **Start Anchor**.

Imagine all your surfaces are attached to a rubber band stretched between the Start and End anchors.

1.  **Move the Start Anchor up**: The entire rubber band compresses. Every surface gets lighter, but they maintain their relative order and separation.
2.  **Move the End Anchor down**: The range compresses. Surfaces get closer together in lightness.

### Why is this better?

In a traditional system (Hex codes), changing the background color breaks everything.

- "I made the background darker, now the cards are invisible."
- "I made the background lighter, now the text contrast is failing."

In the Axiomatic System, the solver **re-runs the physics simulation** every time you change an anchor. It guarantees that:

1.  Surfaces stay visible against the background.
2.  Text stays readable against the surfaces (by adjusting text colors if needed).

## Contrast Distribution

The system doesn't just place surfaces linearly (e.g., 10%, 20%, 30%). It distributes them based on **Perceptual Contrast**.

The human eye is more sensitive to changes in dark colors than light colors. A 5% change in lightness is very noticeable in dark mode, but barely visible in light mode.

The solver accounts for this. It ensures that the **visual step** from Page to Card looks the same in Dark Mode as it does in Light Mode, even if the actual math values are different.
