## Why Algebraic?

Most color systems are just lists of hex codes. You pick a "Primary Blue" and a "Dark Gray" and hope they look good together.

The **Algebraic Color System** is different. It's a **Solver**.

You define the **Constraints** (e.g., "I need a surface that guarantees APCA 60 contrast"), and the system calculates the exact lightness values to meet them.

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Automated Accessibility" icon="approve-check-circle">
    The system uses **APCA** (the future WCAG 3.0 standard) to mathematically
    guarantee readability. If your background changes, your text automatically
    adjusts to maintain contrast.
  </Card>
  <Card title="True Dark Mode" icon="moon">
    Don't maintain two separate palettes. The system understands **Polarity**.
    It automatically inverts your surfaces and recalculates contrast for dark
    mode, ensuring a perfect visual balance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Aware" icon="puzzle">
    Components adapt to their environment. A "Secondary Text" class looks
    different on a white card than it does on a dark tooltip, but it always
    maintains the same *semantic weight*.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modern CSS" icon="rocket">
    Built on the cutting edge of the web platform: **OKLCH**, **Relative Color
    Syntax**, and **CSS Custom Properties**. No JavaScript runtime required for
    the final output.
