## Quick Start: Build a Profile Card

In this 5-minute tutorial, you'll build a fully accessible, dark-mode ready UI component without picking a single hex code.

### Step 1: The Page Surface

Everything starts with a **Surface**. Surfaces provide context for the content inside them. The `surface-page` is your canvas.

<Snippet name="layout-stack" />

### Step 2: Adding a Card

Nest a `surface-card` inside the page. The system automatically adjusts the contrast and borders to ensure it stands out.

<Snippet name="card" />

### Step 3: Adding Interactivity

Add a button using `surface-action`. Notice how we use `hue-brand` to apply your brand color, while the system handles the text contrast automatically.

<Snippet name="button" />

### Step 4: Inputs

Form elements are surfaces too.

<Snippet name="input" />

## Why This Matters

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Automated Accessibility" icon="approve-check-circle">
    The system uses **APCA** (the future WCAG 3.0 standard) to mathematically
    guarantee readability. If your background changes, your text automatically
    adjusts to maintain contrast.
  </Card>
  <Card title="True Dark Mode" icon="moon">
    Don't maintain two separate palettes. The system understands **Polarity**.
    It automatically inverts your surfaces and recalculates contrast for dark
    mode, ensuring a perfect visual balance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Context Aware" icon="puzzle">
    Components adapt to their environment. A "Secondary Text" class looks
    different on a white card than it does on a dark tooltip, but it always
    maintains the same *semantic weight*.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modern CSS" icon="rocket">
    Built on the cutting edge of the web platform: **OKLCH**, **Relative Color
    Syntax**, and **CSS Custom Properties**. No JavaScript runtime required for
    the final output.
  </Card>
