# Axiom IV: The Laws of Integration

These axioms describe how the system interacts with the world, ensuring consistency and interoperability.

## 7. The Code is the Source of Truth

Design tools (Figma, Sketch) are downstream consumers of the code, not the other way around.

### Generation

Tokens are generated from the configuration code.

- We do not manually maintain a Figma library and a CSS file separately.
- We generate the CSS, and (eventually) generate the Figma tokens from the same source.

### No Manual Tweaks

We do not manually tweak individual hex codes in the output.

- If a color looks wrong, we adjust the **algorithm** or the **configuration constraints**.
- This ensures that fixes propagate to the entire system, not just one instance.

### Isomorphism

The core logic (`src/lib`) is isomorphic.

- It runs identically in Node.js (CLI) and the Browser (Theme Builder).
- This ensures the preview in the builder always matches the build output exactly.

## 8. No Magic Numbers

All values are derived from the configuration (Anchors, Curves).

### Math vs. Magic

We reject arbitrary values like "Blue-500" or "Gray-10".

- Why is it 500? Why is it that hex code?
- In Axiomatic Color, every value has a derivation trace.

### Derivation

Every color is the result of a solver function:
$$ Color = f(Context, Intent) $$

- If you change the Context (e.g., darken the theme), the Color updates automatically.

## 9. Baseline Newly Available

We build for the modern web, not the legacy web.

### Policy

We adopt features that are "Newly Available" in major browsers (last 2 versions).

- We do not burden the codebase with polyfills or fallbacks for obsolete browsers unless strictly necessary.
- We believe that by the time this system is widely adopted, these features will be standard.

### Examples

- **Color Spaces**: `oklch()`, `p3` gamut.
- **CSS Features**: `light-dark()`, `@property`, `popover`, `:has()`.
- **Runtime**: Node 24.
