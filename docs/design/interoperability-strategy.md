## The Law of Lossless Interoperability

**We export to other formats without losing semantic meaning.**

Axiomatic Color aims to be the "Source of Truth" for a design system. This means it cannot be an island. It must play nicely with the broader ecosystem of design tools and frameworks.

## The Problem: The "Lowest Common Denominator" Trap

Most interoperability layers degrade data.

- Exporting to Tailwind often means flattening dynamic tokens into static hex codes (`bg-blue-500`).
- Exporting to Figma often means losing the logic of _why_ a color is what it is.

## The Solution: Semantic Transport

We must prioritize formats that preserve the _semantics_ of the system, not just the values.

### 1. Design Tokens Community Group (DTCG)

The DTCG format is the standard for exchanging design tokens.

- **Current State**: We export to DTCG (`tokens.json`).
- **Gap**: We cannot _import_ from it.
- **Goal**: **Round-Trip DTCG**.
  - We should be able to read a `tokens.json` file (generated by Figma or another tool) and "hydrate" our system configuration from it, provided it adheres to our semantic structure.
  - This allows Axiomatic Color to act as the "Engine" behind a Figma-driven workflow.

### 2. Tailwind CSS Preset

Tailwind is the de-facto standard utility framework.

- **Current State**: We export a partial preset.
- **Goal**: **Native Integration**.
  - Instead of just exporting colors, we should export a preset that maps Axiomatic _Concepts_ to Tailwind _Utilities_.
  - `bg-surface-card` should map to our reactive CSS variable, not a static value.
  - This ensures that a Tailwind user gets the full benefit of the "Reactive Pipeline" (Late Binding).

### 3. Figma (Future)

Eventually, we want to generate a Figma Variables collection directly.

- **Challenge**: Figma's variable modes are limited compared to our infinite nesting.
- **Strategy**: We will likely map our "Contexts" (Light/Dark) to Figma Modes, and flatten the "Nesting" logic into explicit variants where necessary.
