# Epoch 29 Planning Update

## Summary

Updated the project plan to prioritize a "Fresh Eyes" and "Zero-to-One" review before proceeding with Developer Tooling.

## Changes

- **Plan Outline**: Inserted **Epoch 29: Fresh Eyes & Zero-to-One Review**.
- **Deferred Work**: Moved "Developer Tooling" to **Epoch 30**.

## Rationale

- **Validation First**: We need to ensure the core system and documentation are usable by humans before we build automated tools on top of them.
- **Fresh Eyes**: A holistic review will identify friction points that unit tests miss.
