# Walkthrough - Epoch 11: Phase 2 - Persona Refinement

In this phase, we updated the project personas to reflect recent learnings from the "Fresh Eyes" audits and align with the new "Constitution" (Axioms).

## Key Changes

### 1. Updated Personas (`docs/design/personas.md`)
We refined the 5 core personas to be more specific about their needs and friction points:

- **Sarah (The Overwhelmed Pragmatist)**: Now explicitly highlights her sensitivity to CLI failures and documentation inaccuracies.
- **Alex (The Visual Tinkerer)**: Emphasizes the need for "Immediate Feedback" and "Playgrounds" (Theme Builder).
- **Jordan (The Accessibility Champion)**: Clarifies the need for "Proof of Compliance" (APCA vs WCAG).
- **Dr. Chen (The Color Scientist)**: Links her interests to the new "Laws of Physics" axioms.
- **Marcus (The System Architect)**: Adds a specific requirement for "Lossless Interoperability" (P3 support in exports).

## Rationale
These updates ensure that our personas are not just static archetypes but active tools for evaluating the system. By explicitly listing their "Needs" based on recent audit findings, we can better prioritize future work (like fixing the CLI docs or improving the DTCG exporter).
