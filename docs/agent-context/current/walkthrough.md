# Phase 3 Walkthrough: Design & Concept

In this phase, we conducted a comprehensive design audit of the Theme Builder V1 to identify why it wasn't meeting our aspirational goals.

## Key Activities

1.  **Design Audit**: We analyzed the current UI against our core axioms ("Context is King", "Physics of Light").
    - _Finding_: The UI was a "Form Filler", not a "System Modeler".
    - _Finding_: The hierarchy of context was invisible.
    - _Finding_: Users were "flying blind" regarding gamut clipping.

2.  **Concept Definition**: We defined the requirements for V2.
    - **Context Tree**: A hierarchical view of the system.
    - **Gamut Visualization**: A visual guide to color space constraints.
    - **Direct Manipulation**: Interactive graphs instead of abstract sliders.

3.  **Linting & Cleanup**: We resolved strict linting issues to ensure a clean codebase for the upcoming implementation phase.

## Outcome

We have a clear roadmap for **Phase 4: V2 Implementation**, which will focus on building the components defined in the audit.
