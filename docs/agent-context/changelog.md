**Completed Work**:

- **Audit**: Conducted a comprehensive audit of Documentation, Theme Builder, and CLI.
- **Findings**:
  - **Package Name Mismatch**: Identified a critical error in `installation.md` pointing to the wrong package name.
  - **Incomplete Exports**: Discovered that DTCG and Tailwind exports are missing Chart Colors and Primitives because they are calculated in the CSS generator, not the core solver.
  - **Node Version**: Noted a discrepancy between documentation (v18+) and `package.json` (v25+).
- **Deliverables**:
  - Created `docs/design/fresh-eyes-audit-3.md` with detailed findings.
  - Prioritized a list of critical fixes for the next phase.

## Epoch 14: Svelte 5 + Astro Hydration Research

### Phase 2: Reproduction via Isolation (Completed)

- **Visualizer Fixes**:
  - Refactored `HueShiftVisualizer` to use native SVG Cubic Bezier paths (`<path d="M... C...">`) for smoother rendering.
  - Fixed a critical visibility bug where the curve stroke color was using an undefined CSS variable (`--key-brand-color`). Swapped to `--text-high-token`.
  - Added UI controls to toggle control handles and improved the default curve shape.
- **Documentation Integration**:
  - Integrated the interactive `HueShiftVisualizer` directly into `hue-shifting.mdx`.
  - Removed the broken "Static (SSR)" version of the component to avoid user confusion.
- **Findings**:
  - The reported "hydration errors" were likely red herrings or secondary to the visual bugs. The component hydrates correctly with `client:load` when CSS variables are present.

### Phase 1: Isolated Reproduction (Completed)

- **Isolation Strategy**: Created `src/pages/repro.astro` to test Svelte 5 components in isolation.
- **Verification**: Confirmed that basic Svelte 5 Runes (`$state`, `$derived`) and Context API work correctly in Astro.

  - Added `.stackblitzrc` for better "Try it" experience.
- **Documentation Expansion**:
  - Added a comprehensive **Ember Integration Guide** (`guides/frameworks/ember.mdx`).
  - Clarified **Build vs. Runtime** modes in documentation.
- **Production Verification**:
  - Verified production builds locally.
  - Confirmed GitHub Pages deployment configuration.
- **Review Materials**:
  - Created `REVIEW.md` and `known-issues.md` to facilitate external review.
