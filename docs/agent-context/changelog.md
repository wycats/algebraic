  - Refactored "Mental Model" chapters (`thinking-in-surfaces`, `physics-of-light`).
  - Updated "Getting Started" and "Catalog" guides.
- **Phase 3: Visual & Interactive Polish**:
  - **Data Visualization Demo**: Implemented `DataVizDemo` to visualize the `--chart-*` tokens with live bar and pie charts.
  - **Visual Hierarchy**: Introduced `.docs-card` and `.docs-card-header` to fix alignment and spacing issues in grid layouts.
  - **Theme Sync**: Fixed desynchronization between Starlight's theme picker and the internal `ThemeContext`.
- **Phase 4: Dogfooding & Robustness**:
  - **Strategy**: Configured the docs site to generate and consume its own theme using the `color-system` CLI.
  - **Refactor**: Updated `DynamicRange`, `HueShiftVisualizer`, and other components to use generated CSS variables (`--surface-*`, `--chart-*`) instead of hardcoded values.
  - **Linting**: Added `lint:colors` script to forbid hardcoded colors in the documentation codebase.
