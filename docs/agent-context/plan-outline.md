## Epoch 33: Conceptual Integrity Review (Active)

- **Goal**: Conduct a thorough review of the entire project for conceptual integrity, ensuring alignment with the core axioms and identifying any architectural drift.
- **Phases**:
  - **Phase 1: Architecture & Axiom Audit (Planned)**
    - **Goal**: Review the codebase and documentation against the "Constitution" (Axioms) to ensure strict adherence to principles like Late Binding and Determinism.
  - **Phase 2: Documentation Consistency (Planned)**
    - **Goal**: Verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system and that the "User Journey" is coherent.
  - **Phase 3: Remediation Plan (Planned)**
    - **Goal**: Create a prioritized plan to address any conceptual gaps or inconsistencies found during the audit.
