  - **Phase 3: Design & Concept (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Audit the current design, explore new concepts, and review architecture.
  - **Phase 4: V2 Implementation (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Implement the new "System Modeling" UI, including Context Tree, Gamut Visualization, and Direct Manipulation graphs.
  - **Phase 5: Cleanup & Consolidation (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Refactor utility classes and consolidate CSS architecture for long-term maintainability.

## Epoch 22: Fresh Eyes Audit (Completed)

- **Goal**: Conduct a comprehensive "Fresh Eyes" audit of the entire project (CLI, Docs, Theme Builder, Codebase) to identify friction points, inconsistencies, and areas for improvement before starting the Developer Tooling epoch.
- **Phases**:
  - **Phase 1: Audit & Plan (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: systematic review of the project and creation of a prioritized remediation plan.
  - **Phase 2: Luminance Spectrum UI (Deferred)**
    - **Goal**: Implement the "Luminance Spectrum" visualization to replace the disconnected "Page Anchors" sliders, providing a unified view of the lightness axis.

## Epoch 23: Presets & Utilities (Completed)

- **Goal**: Implement a robust system for presets (Typography, Borders) and refactor the CSS engine to support reactive composition.
- **Phases**:
  - **Phase 1: Reactive Pipeline & Presets (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Refactor `engine.css` to use late-binding variables and implement Bezier-based typography scaling.

## Epoch 24: Fresh Eyes Simulation (Planned)

- **Goal**: Validate the end-to-end user experience by simulating a new user adopting the system in a fresh environment, identifying friction points in the documentation and CLI.
- **Phases**:
  - **Phase 1: The "Zero to One" Simulation**
    - **Goal**: Create a fresh, isolated project and attempt to install/configure the library using _only_ the public instructions.
  - **Phase 2: The "Integration" Simulation**
    - **Goal**: Attempt to build a simple UI using the "Reactive Pipeline" features in this fresh project.
  - **Phase 3: Remediation**
    - **Goal**: Fix the issues discovered in the Friction Log.
  - **Phase 4: LLM Context Strategy (Research)**
    - **Goal**: Design the strategy for generating `llms.txt` from the now-verified documentation.

## Epoch 25: Developer Tooling (Planned)

- **Goal**: Create a world-class developer experience for users of the Axiomatic Color system.
- **Phases**:
  - **Phase 1: VS Code Extension**
    - **Goal**: Visualize tokens inline, provide hover information, and autocomplete.
  - **Phase 2: Custom Lints**
    - **Goal**: Create ESLint or Stylelint rules to enforce system constraints (e.g., "No hardcoded colors", "Use semantic tokens").
  - **Phase 3: AI Context (llms.txt)**
    - **Goal**: Provide a standardized context file for LLMs to understand the system's architecture and tokens.
