[View Completed Epochs (1-32)](history/completed-epochs.md)

## Epoch 33: Conceptual Integrity Review (Completed)

- **Goal**: Conduct a thorough review of the entire project for conceptual integrity, ensuring alignment with the core axioms and identifying any architectural drift.
- **Phases**:
  - **Phase 1: Architecture & Axiom Audit (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Review the codebase and documentation against the "Constitution" (Axioms) to ensure strict adherence to principles like Late Binding and Determinism.
  - **Phase 2: Documentation Consistency (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of the system and that the "User Journey" is coherent.
  - **Phase 3: Remediation Plan (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Create a prioritized plan to address any conceptual gaps or inconsistencies found during the audit.

## Epoch 34: Refinement & Education (Completed)

- **Goal**: Execute the remediation plan from Epoch 33, focusing on infrastructure robustness, token simplification, and interactive education.
- **Phases**:
  - **Phase 1: Infrastructure (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Replace the fragile `cat` build script with **Lightning CSS** to enable robust bundling, minification, and standard CSS enforcement.
  - **Phase 2: Token Simplification (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Reduce the API surface area by hiding internal tokens and exposing only semantic intents.
  - **Phase 3: Export & Validation (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Ensure the system is "Beta-Ready" by enabling live export previews in the Theme Builder and enforcing configuration validity.
  - **Phase 4: Interactive Tutorials (Deferred)**
    - **Goal**: Create "Learn by Doing" tutorials to guide users through the system's concepts.

## Epoch 35: Deployment & Release (Active)

- **Goal**: Deploy the updated system to production and verify the live site.
- **Phases**:
  - **Phase 1: Pre-Flight Verification (Completed)**
    - **Goal**: Verify that the build works locally and all checks pass before deployment.
  - **Phase 2: Deployment (Active)**
    - **Goal**: Trigger the deployment and verify the live site.
