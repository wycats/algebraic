# Introduction

Welcome to the **Color System** documentation.

This system is a semantic, automated color palette generator designed for modern web applications. It prioritizes accessibility, adaptability, and developer experience.

## Key Features

- **Automated Contrast**: Lightness values are solved mathematically to ensure APCA/WCAG compliance.
- **Themeable**: Change a few "Anchors" and "Key Colors" to generate a completely new theme.
- **Platform Native**: Built on modern CSS features like `oklch`, `@property`, and `light-dark()`.
- **Framework Agnostic**: Core logic is pure TypeScript; output is standard CSS.
